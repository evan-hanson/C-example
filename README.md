# Most Common Words Sorting Project

This project imports the Hunger Games book with all the punctuation removed.  It removes any words that are on the mostCommon.cpp which are the 50 most commone words in the english language.  Then it counts the number of instances of each unique word and rearanges them into a list of the most common words in the book.  The file is then imported into MATLAB and creates a Word Cloud of all the words.  This project used C++ and MATLAB code.
